# ECS
An ECS I made.
## Context:
I come from a non professional Luau Roblox background.
I started programming in C for the first time around late July of 2022.
I had used many ECS libraries in roblox for around 1.5-ish years prior to starting C and was infatuated with them. It's a shame most of the ones I used were terribly complex. But a friend I met had showed me their simple lua ecs and I was astonished with how small it was. It cheated quite a bit on the performance front by essentially storing a pointer inside every component, but that made the ecs very small and easy to understand front to back. When I started in C, I wanted to recreate my friends ecs in C to learn better learn C. I completed it early early October of 2022. With a basic understanding of C
I started writing this ECS sometime around October of 2022.
This is somewhere around the 20th rewrite.
